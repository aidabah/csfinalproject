Housing Prediction Project

In this project we are analyzing Kaggle Housing Prices. We are searching if there will be a significant difference in house sale prices based on the various features like number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, area, square footage, etc.

1) Data Cleaning:
We used one-hot encoding for binary columns such as “yes” or “no
Encoded non-binary columns like furniture status
Removed duplicates
Normalized data frame

2) Visulaization:
Created a boxplot of entire data set to see major outliers 
Created a heat map that shows the highest correlated columns to price

3) Models:
Linear Regression models
Ridge regression 
Random Forest 
KMeans 

4) SQL Model:
Created 4 tables to categorize our data based on related columns
properties, features, financial, furnishing_status
